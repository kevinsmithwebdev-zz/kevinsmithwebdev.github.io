I love learning new libraries and technologies, so please don't be afraid to ask. Technologies I also use include RESTful APIs (use and development), sockets, and JSON.
In my past life as a programmer and then hobbyist, I have also worked with Pascal, C, Assembly, Fortran, Cobol, Basic, VBA, C++, and Java.

My name is Kevin. I am a web developer/designer. I do freelance work and am also looking for a permanant position.

I began my professional career working in hightech, building computer chips in a leading R&amp;D cleanroom. I often did programming work and took many programming courses while studying electrical engineering. I studied Basic and Pascal in high school. For my programming at work, I started in Pascal but taught myself C and used that. In college, I studied a lot of C, among others.

I left the hightech world to pursue a career in jazz guitar. I eventually earned an MA in music and have had a fun career. But I have always missed programming and even dabbled a little on the side.

Deciding that I need a better day job, I have come back to my programming roots. In February of 2017 I began the program at Free Code Camp and completed their certificates in Front End Development, Data Visualization, and Back End Development. I am also an active moderator on their forum and a contributor to their code.

I will never tire of playing music, but I've enjoyed spending my days coding - the best of both worlds.
